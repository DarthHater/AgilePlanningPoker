Hola! To get this running you'll need to setup a developer console app with Google, in the Hangout API.

Host the AgilePlanningPoker.xml somewhere (preferrably on https) that is publically accesible

Host the js file somewhere that will be available to the hangout (can be an internal server if you plan to use solely internal)

Voila!
